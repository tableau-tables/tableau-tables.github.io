# Tableau Tables

Tableau tables is an enhanced markup for Markdown tables, written as a library to
make it easy to add as a plugin to existing Markdown processors.

I created tableau because I use Markdown to write standalone documents,
and I needed better support for tabular material:

#### Headers

* Headerless tables
* Multiline headers
* Multiple separate headers
* Headers in columns and rows
* Captions

#### Layout

* Layout uses CSS styles and not inline attributes (making it easier to
  change the style of a whole document)
* Per cell alignment and CSS classes
* Default attributes, both down columns and across rows
* Table-wide classes
* Row and column span
* Continuation lines

For information on using Tableau Tables (and writing plugins for currently
unsupported Markdown processors), see the [documention
site](https://tableau-tables.github.io).]
